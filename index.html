           <p>Indonesia is the country with the largest number of tropical forests in the world. Indonesia's forests are a huge source of biodiversity and are essential for human survival. However, in recent decades, Indonesia has experienced significant forest destruction, mainly due to deforestation and conversion of forest land into agricultural land, plantations and settlements.</p>
           <p>This has resulted in habitat loss for many animal and plant species, as well as negative impacts on communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods, such as indigenous tribes and smallholder farmers. In addition, deforestation also impacts global climate change, as forests act as carbon dioxide sinks.</p>
           <p>To solve this problem, we at Indonesian Forest Conservation are here to educate and participate in preserving forests. Together with various parties we started forest conservation and land restoration programs, including establishing forestry conservation companies such as Perusahaan Konservasi Kehutanan Indonesia that focus on preserving forests and biodiversity. These programs aim to protect Indonesia's natural resources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and improve the welfare of local forest-dependent communities.</p>

            <p>Since Russia invaded their country a year ago, that habit has been broken. The once lush Oskil River has been destroyed. Villages have been destroyed, residents displaced, trees scorched, birdsong no longer heard, replaced by the rumble of steel tanks perched on the banks of the river (March 2, 20023).</p>
